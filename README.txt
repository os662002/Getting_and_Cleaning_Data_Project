In the repos, could be find : 
- run_analysis.R : the R code used to produce the tidy data containing the "independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject" - the resulting dataframe is "tAVEmergedData_set"
- All the diffrents steps used to produce this data frame are described in the run_analysis.html produced by knitr. I also added the md intermediate file : CodeBook.md.
The best for reading is using knitr to produce the html file.


I got problem with the setwd. I hope you'll be able to execute the R code quite easily.

Hope this help

Best regards,
